# Adventures in TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a very powerful tool. Although its most common uses are in the design of neural networks, it can easily be used for solving general numerical problems while leveraging the power of GPUs.
This repository contains demo solutions for interesting problems in Computer Vision.

## Video Motion Amplification
<div align="center">

</div>

Here we implement a simplified variant of the motion magnification technique of [Wadhwa et al](#wadhwa2013). This algorithm decomposes the input video into a representation that allows them to infer the spatial phases of each pixel in a localized way. The local phases of each reference frame is removed from all subsequent frames, which leaves the temporal component of the phases. This component is then manipulated and added back to the original signals.

### Running
```bash
python main.py motion-amplification data/videos/baby.avi --show-progress \
                                    --max-frames 90 --intensity 10
```

## Rectified Stereo Matching

This demo is inspired by the technique from [Steinbrucker et al](#steinbrucker2009), where the objective function is optimized in alternating steps with respect to two independent variables `v` (the desired disparity map) and `u` (an auxiliary flow).
As the name suggests, the input images are expected to be [rectified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_rectification).

### Running
```bash
python main.py rectified-stereo --left data/stereo/motorcycle/im_left.png \
                                --right data/stereo/motorcycle/im_right.png \
                                --groundtruth data/stereo/motorcycle/gt.npz
```

This demo implements a dense image tracker, which required defining an image sampler operation with custom gradient with respect to the input coordinates. It also implements some tricks to increase robustness to relatively large displacements between the input images (namely coarse-to-fine processing of images using different levels of blurring and scales).

### Running

```bash
python main.py image-registration data/pairs/sample1_a.jpg \
                                  data/pairs/sample1_b.jpg
